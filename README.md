# Accela
_A GUI for [depotdownloadermod](https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/DepotDownloaderMod/)_

Accela is intended to be used with a modded steam client (for Windows see: Greenluma, Steamtools, Lucky Game Tools, Tek injector & Runtime | Gnu+Linux users see: SLS Steam)

So, you like having two apps that do the same thing? Perfect! This tool gives you a second downloader UI. 
Now you have a modded Steam client (ie. SLS Steam) as a downloader and DepotDownloaderMod with this GUI too!

## Why install two programs to do the exact same thing? 
The whole idea stems from how Arch Linux users never shut up about bloat, like it’s some mortal sin against the holy church of minimalism, while a ton of us are just sitting here blinking slowly and thinking, “Uh... why exactly is having 30 different ways to do the exact same thing a problem again?”

I mean, seriously, is the duplicate binary personally offending you? Is it sending you rude DMs at 3 a.m.? More choice is genuinely nice. It’s variety, it’s freedom, it’s the software equivalent of walking into a grocery store and discovering they stock seventeen brands of ketchup instead of just one sad state-approved bottle.

Computers these days come with a bajillion gigs of RAM and storage, literally enough to store the entire Library of Congress twice and still have room for your 4K meme collection, so why not just... have more options? Why not let the distro throw in every conceivable tool, widget, and redundant library known to humankind? Who are we hurting here? The electrons? The poor little SSD sectors that might have to work an extra millisecond?

It’s not like your machine is going to huff and puff and collapse under the weight of an extra 500 MB. We’re not running on 128 MB of RAM and a 40 GB spinning rust drive from 2003 anymore. Let the package manager install whatever it wants. Let the options bloom like a glorious, chaotic garden. If you don’t like one tool, just... don’t use it. The other 29 will sit quietly in /usr/bin, judging you silently for your ascetic lifestyle, but otherwise minding their own business.

Honestly, the real bloat is all that time spent obsessing over shaving off 2.3 MB when you could be doing literally anything else with your life. Live a little. Embrace the excess. Your computer can handle it. 😏
