So, you like having two apps that do the same thing? Perfect! This tool gives you a second downloader UI. Now you have SLS Steam as a downloader and DepotDownloaderMod with this… scuffed GUI.

Two programs to do the exact same thin, how efficient! 
The idea came from the fact that so many users of Arch Linux go on and on about bloat, and I don't see why having 30 different things to do the same thing is a problem. More choice is nice. Computers have a bajillion RAM and storage now, so why not just have more options?

## Not my code, not my project, just hosting the code :)
